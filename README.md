# angular-timer â€” A simple AngularJS directive demonstrating re-usability & interoperability

Added intervalEvent attribute and an example

Added intervalEvent which broadcasts a named event for each timer on the
$rootScope every interval.

This allows periodic events that can be consumed, for instance, to save
a document occasionally.
