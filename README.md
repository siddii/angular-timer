# angular-timer — A simple AngularJS directive demonstrating re-usability & interoperability

Added intervalEvent attribute and an example

Added intervalEvent which broadcasts "event:timer-interval" on the
$rootScope every interval.

This allows periodic events that can be consumed, for instance, to save
a document occasionally.
