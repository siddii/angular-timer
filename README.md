# angular-timer â€” A simple AngularJS directive demonstrating re-usability & interoperability

Sample AngularJS directive

This fork:

Create the bower support to deploy a package on Bower

Instructions: 
bower bump > to increase the version of the tag. Current: v1.0.0

Create the first tag v1.0.0 for this project and deploy the package to bower:
bower register angular-timer-bower git://github.com/siddii/angular-timer.git

Or:
bower register angular-timer git://github.com/siddii/angular-timer.git

Since I've created the angular-bower to my endpoint, this package name will be unavaliable until the bower team remove manually this package.
I create a request to remove this package at https://github.com/bower/bower/issues/120
